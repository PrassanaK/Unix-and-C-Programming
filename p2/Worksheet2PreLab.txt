1.
a)  inserts content of marvellous.h into source code.
    it is a standard header file 

b)  inserts content of marvellous.h into source code.
    it is a custom header file

c)  LENGTH is defined as a constant value and is given the value 100

d)  CUBE a piece of code with parameters
    CUBE(a + b) == ((a + b)*(a + b)*(a + b))

e)  CALC(x,y,z) ((x) + CUBE(y) + CUBE(CUBE(z)))
    CALC(x,y,z) == ((x) + ((y)*(y)*(y)) + ((CUBE(z))*(CUBE(z))*(CUBE(z)))

f)  printf("%d", LENGTH); only be compiled if LENGTH has been defined at the top, otherwise it will just be edited out by the preprocessor

g)  printf("Hello world/n"); will not be compiled because THEFILE has been defined below the #ifndef directive



3.
a)  Creates high coupling
    No locality. Code is easier to understand if scope of the variables are limited and passed between methods

b)  static makes the function inaccessible outside the file which is counter intuitive

4. 
a)  database.h, util.h
b)  database.h, util.c,interface.c
c)  main.o, database.o, interface.c
d)  none
e)  none
f)  util.o
